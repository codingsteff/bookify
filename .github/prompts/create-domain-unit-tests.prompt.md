Ask for the feature folder if not provided.

I want you to check out the `src/Bookify.Domain/[FEATURE]` project and the entities and domain services defined there, and then write unit tests to cover all the interesting behavior that we have inside.

The Unit Tests should be written in the `test/Bookify.Domain.UnitTests/[FEATURE]` project, and you should create a new file for each entity or domain service that you are testing.

You should use the @BookingTests.cs class as a baseline of how the tests should look like. Pay attention to the arrange-act-assert structure of the tests, and the naming convention for the test cases.
